# Land-Moisture-Control-System
The aim of our system is for it to be a one stop solution to all the farmersâ€™ agricultural problems, a reliable and simple solution which can be implemented at a low cost, but at the same time be complex enough to handle the problems faced on the field. We plan to design a grid of sensors which can accurately track the moisture in large fields and a system to send the same information to the cloud, so that the data might be accessed at the convenience of the farmer. The system at the same time has to also sustain with the harsh conditions in the field and the lack of constant power supply. We will be using low cost power efficient microcontrollers and simple interface so as to make the system easy to use.  The Grid Based Land Data Moisture Acquisition and Control System has 3 main goals:  1. To reduce the unplanned use of water in agricultural land, thereby conserving water. 2. To work automatically and cope with harsh conditions in the field so as to reduce the load taken by the farmer for monitoring the pumps and irrigation, thus saving a lot of man-hours which can be used to increase productivity. 3. To provide an affordable solution to Indian farmers, which has a very simple interface and is versatile enough to work with existing equipment.
